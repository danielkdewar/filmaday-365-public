Joaquin is fantastic and never fails to impress me. Although Phoneix delivers such an incredible performance, he is still outshone by Philip Seymour Hoffman - a true testament to PSH's ability. Hoffman truly was a master of his craft in both theatre and film. He leaves a huge hole in the acting world and will always remain a true inspiration. I can only hope this sensitive soul has found peace.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> I've always had a great liking for this despite it being quite inscrutable. I'm now finding it to be such a sad film. Dodd's realisation and his admission to Quell at the end is heartbreaking. A monumental achievement from Hoffman and Phoenix. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Who is The Master? And what the hell is Freddy Quell?">

DiCaprio's numerous pep talks, which are extravagent performances in by themselves, gives you the impression that Wall Street is run almost like a cult.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> Scorcese's feelings on the subject are made known. There were some great scenes in amongst scenes that outstayed their welcome. I didn't find the characters all that compelling. I think Scorcese made the perfect film for the subject and exactly the film he wanted to make. Do I care? I don't know. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Really rich white men.">

It's just hidden in the darkness and outside the tights frames. And normally I complain about modern movies that don't know how to finish and go for too long.

That said, it wasn't awful. A pretty solid effort for a debut.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> A few interesting things going on in the sound design during opening credits. What follows is mostly uninteresting. It's made so that it not only shows you but also tells you what's happening. This is lowest common demoninator filmmaking. There's probably an audience for this.

There's some incredible scenes throughout. Think of it as The Wolf of Wall Street with dialogue instead of coke and nudity.<br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Robert Pattinson. White and serious.">

Even a 12 year old boy.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> One of those great films filled awareness and brilliance. The performances here are so natural and honest. Sometimes you think it's in the developing world, then you remember it's just Queens. But then you remember that many parts of America could be considered a part of the developing world. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Alejandro. Living in the forgotten America.">

Monty's monologue is one of the best in film history. Fantastic performances by all cast members, excellent script and great artistic choices. I can't fault it. Spike Lee is a genius.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> It's a shame Spike Lee is mostly associated as being a filmmaker who is obsessed with race. I wonder if that's because he's dark-skinned? He's one of cinema's great visual innovators. One of my favourite filmmakers. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> This life came so close to never happening.">

Admittedly it wasn't as exciting watching at home as in the theatre, but I was still just as tense and on the edge of my seat the second time around.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> It loses impact outside a theatre (the exposition and daughter story is shown for how weak it really is) but the film is still highly effective. In years to come, we will all be cringing at the obvious 3D effects. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> White people in space. But it's gorgeous.">

John C Reilly really doesn't get anywhere near the amount of credit he deserves as an actor.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> This is such a huge film. PTA takes on so many large themes and inserts many big scenes for his actors. Wonderfully ambitious and he pulls it off. Jason Robards monologue is one of cinema's greatest. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us.">
