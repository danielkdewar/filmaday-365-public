I rarely find rom-coms or disaster films enjoyable, yet the merging of the two genres was almost seamless. Surprisingly funny and equally heartbreaking.

They underline great devestation with the spirituality and insanity that makes up the soul of the nation. I cared about who survived and that's a great marker for any distaster film.

What was shaping up to be a thought provoking movie ended up being nothing more than a cheap thrill. <br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> I love the kinetic energy of Boyle's editing but thought he overcooked this one towards the end.

A fantastic addition to their filmography.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> This is the Coen Brothers film I relate to most. Not only is it possible that I am becoming a failure, I already am. I'm glad they continue to discuss this in their work. It's a direct challenge to the American psyche. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Llewyn plays the wrong song instinctually." >
