A fantastic addition to their filmography.<br><br> <strong>HIM:</strong> This is the Coen Brothers film I relate to most. Not only is it possible that I am becoming a failure, I already am. I'm glad they continue to discuss this in their work. It's a direct challenge to the American psyche. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Llewyn plays the wrong song instinctually." >
