I had no idea it was based on a teen novel. Reading about the novel afterward, the film seems much stronger and more adult, but it's still not very good. There are some interesting moments, but to appeal to a teen audience they have kept the running time short, meaning a war that is supposed to be draining appears to come and go in a matter of days. <br><br> <strong>#FilmInAFrame</strong> Jon Hopkins can improve any film with his music.">
